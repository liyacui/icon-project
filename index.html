<h3 style="color: royalblue">Disinterest in the vaccine</h3>
<p>Vaccination rates have plummeted since New Yorkers got their first doses. 91.7% of the city has at least one Covid vaccine, and 81% completed the primary series, or at least two vaccines. But only 16% received the bivalent booster released in the fall of 2022.</p>

<h3 style="color: royalblue">Eris facts</h3>
<p>Omicron subvariant EG.5, or Eris, recently became the most dominant strain of Covid in the US. Early studies do not show that it leads to more severe Covid cases, but it may be more contagious. The virus has a mutation that can help it evade immunity from a previous infection or vaccination.</p>

<h3 style="color: royalblue">NYC numbers</h3>
<p>Across NYC, new cases and hospitalizations steadily climbed since the summer, peaked around mid-September, and have started to decline again. In the last 7 days, the city has seen a daily average of 1,025 total cases, 53 hospitalizations, and 2 deaths.</p>

<h3 style="color: royalblue">What’s next?</h3>
<p>Just because cases are currently declining doesn’t mean they’ll stay that way. Cases could rise again later this winter, as they did last year in early December. The CDC expects that hospitalizations due to the impending “tripledemic” (Covid, flu, and RSV) this winter will be similar to last year—still higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p>
